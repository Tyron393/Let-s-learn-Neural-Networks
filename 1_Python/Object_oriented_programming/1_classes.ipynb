    "# Basic Classes and Objects\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, `classes` are blueprints for creating `objects`, which are specific **instances** of these classes. A class defines a template that encapsulates data and behaviors by bundling **attributes** (data) and **methods** (functions that operate on this data) together. Each object created from a class can have its own unique attribute values while sharing the structure and functionality defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes promote modularity and reusability by organizing code into logical, self-contained units. Through **object-oriented** principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, classes allow developers to build more complex and scalable applications by modeling real-world concepts as code."

    "## Other Useful Dunder methods\n",
    "\n",
    "### Arithmetic Dunders\n",
    "These methods allow you to define custom behavior for arithmetic operations on objects, making them act like numbers. They include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__add__`: For addition (`+`)\n",
    "- `__sub__`: For subtraction (`-`)\n",
    "- `__mul__`: For multiplication (`*`)\n",
    "- `__truediv__`: For true division (`/`)\n",
    "- `__floordiv__`: For floor division (`//`)\n",
    "- `__mod__`: For modulo (`%`)\n",
    "- `__pow__`: For exponentiation (`**`)\n",
    "- `__radd__`, `__rsub__`, etc.: For right-hand versions of these operators, enabling custom behavior when the object appears on the right side of an operator (e.g., `2 + obj`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Attribute Access Dunders\n",
    "These methods let you customize attribute access, assignment, and deletion:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getattr__`: Called when an attribute that doesn’t exist is accessed. Useful for dynamic attributes.\n",
    "- `__getattribute__`: Called every time an attribute is accessed. Often used for overriding attribute access but should be used carefully to avoid infinite recursion.\n",
    "- `__setattr__`: Called when an attribute is set, allowing custom behavior for attribute assignment.\n",
    "- `__delattr__`: Called when an attribute is deleted using `del`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Container/Collection Dunders\n",
    "These methods allow objects to act like collections or containers, making them compatible with indexing, slicing, and containment checks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__getitem__`: Allows indexing (`obj[key]`), commonly used in classes that represent collections or mappings.\n",
    "- `__setitem__`: Allows setting values with indexing (`obj[key] = value`).\n",
    "- `__delitem__`: Allows deletion of items using indexing (`del obj[key]`).\n",
    "- `__contains__`: Defines behavior for membership checks (`in` keyword), enabling expressions like `element in obj`."
