    "# Inheritance and abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance and abstraction are two fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming that help manage complexity, promote code reuse, and establish clear relationships between classes. **Inheritance** allows a class (the **child** or **subclass**) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (the **parent** or **superclass**), enabling code reuse and often forming a class hierarchy. **Abstraction**, on the other hand, hides unnecessary implementation details from the user, exposing only essential elements. Python supports abstraction through **abstract base classes** (`ABC`s), which define methods that subclasses must implement, enforcing a specific structure and providing a blueprint for consistent subclass behavior. Together, inheritance and abstraction help in building modular, maintainable, and scalable code.\n",

    "To create a subclass that inherits from a superclass, we specify the superclass in parentheses after the subclass name."

    "\n",
    "A subclass can **override** methods from its superclass by **redefining** them with its own implementation. This allows the subclass to customize or extend the behavior of the inherited methods to better suit its specific needs. When a method is overridden, the subclass’s version of the method is called instead of the superclass’s version.\n",

    "To still access the superclass’s original implementation, the `super()` function can be used within the subclass method. `super()` returns a temporary object of the superclass, allowing access to its methods and properties. This is particularly useful when you want to extend or modify inherited behavior without completely replacing it. For instance, you can call a superclass method and then add extra steps or modifications in the subclass method, which helps maintain code modularity and reusability by reducing redundancy and ensuring that shared logic stays in the superclass."
