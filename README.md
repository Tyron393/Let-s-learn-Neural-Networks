# Let-s-learn-Neural-Networks
Welcome to the **Let-s-learn-Neural-Networks** repository! ðŸŽ‰ This repository is designed as a comprehensive learning resource for anyone looking to understand the world of **Deep Learning** from the **ground up**. Here, youâ€™ll find a structured guide to mastering essential tools, foundational knowledge, and practical skills to build, train, and deploy neural networks. Whether youâ€™re new to programming or brushing up on deep learning concepts, youâ€™ll find resources to help at every stage.

## Repository Overview
In this repository, we'll start with the basics of **Python** programming, build a strong understanding of **Numpy** for mathematical operations, and gradually dive deep into the world of **PyTorch** to understand neural networks, **machine learning** (ML), and **deep learning** (DL). Through code examples, exercises, and projects, youâ€™ll gain hands-on experience and practical knowledge of building, training, and optimizing neural networks.

## Usage
Each module in this repository is structured with Jupyter notebooks that contain detailed code examples, explanations, and exercises. These notebooks allow you to interact with the code, make changes, and observe results in real-time. Additionally, each folder includes a README file that provides a high-level overview of the topic covered in that module.

To get started with a module, navigate to the appropriate folder, read through the README for a general overview, and open the corresponding Jupyter notebooks to dive into the code and explanations.
